## 1. Difficulty Manipulation Attacks

### Attack Vector: Hashrate Oscillation

**Description**: Attacker joins with massive hashrate, drives difficulty up, then leaves suddenly.

**How it works**:
```
Step 1: Attacker joins with 100x normal hashrate
  ‚Üí Difficulty rises from 131,072 to 10,000,000
  ‚Üí Takes ~20 blocks (20 seconds)

Step 2: Attacker suddenly leaves
  ‚Üí Honest miners struggle with high difficulty
  ‚Üí Blocks come very slowly (60s+)
  ‚Üí Difficulty wants to drop rapidly

Step 3: WITHOUT PROTECTION (old algorithm):
  ‚Üí Difficulty drops from 10M ‚Üí 131k in 189 blocks
  ‚Üí Attacker rejoins at low difficulty
  ‚Üí Mines tons of blocks easily
  ‚Üí Can reorganize chain

Step 4: WITH HYBRID PROTECTION (new algorithm):
  ‚Üí Difficulty CANNOT drop below 1M (10% of peak)
  ‚Üí Difficulty CANNOT drop below 5M (50% of 100 blocks ago)
  ‚Üí Attacker finds difficulty still HIGH when rejoining
  ‚Üí Attack FAILS ‚úÖ
```

**Risk Level OLD**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Attack succeeds
**Risk Level NEW**: üü¢ LOW - Attack prevented by hybrid protection

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ Layer 2: Peak Memory (can't drop below 10% of max in last 100 blocks)
- ‚úÖ Layer 3: Historical Floor (can't drop below 50% of 100 blocks ago)

---

### Attack Vector: Slow Drip Attack

**Description**: Attacker alternates between mining and not mining to keep difficulty unstable.

**How it works**:
```
Block N:   Attacker mines (fast block)  ‚Üí Difficulty UP
Block N+1: Attacker waits (slow block)  ‚Üí Difficulty DOWN
Block N+2: Attacker mines (fast block)  ‚Üí Difficulty UP
...repeat...
Result: Difficulty oscillates, network unstable
```

**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ Historical floor prevents drops below 50% of 100 blocks ago
- ‚úÖ Peak memory prevents drops below 10% of recent max
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Attacker can still cause some instability but cannot profit

---

## 2. 51% Attack Analysis

### What is a 51% Attack?

When a miner controls >50% of network hashrate, they can:
1. Double-spend coins (spend same coins twice)
2. Censor transactions (refuse to include certain txs)
3. Reorganize the chain (rewrite recent history)

### Halo's 51% Attack Surface

**Current Network State**:
- Halo is a **permissioned/private network initially**
- You control the miners
- Difficulty adjusted for your hashrate

**Risk Scenarios**:

#### Scenario A: Internal Malicious Miner (LOW RISK)
```
Setup: You control 3 mining nodes
Risk: One of your nodes goes rogue
Impact: Can mine more blocks but LIMITED by difficulty
Mitigation:
  - Monitor all your mining nodes
  - High difficulty (131k+) makes attack expensive
  - Other miners will reject invalid blocks
```
**Risk Level**: üü¢ LOW (you control the miners)

#### Scenario B: External Attacker Joins (MEDIUM RISK)
```
Setup: Public mainnet launch
Risk: Attacker with massive hashrate joins
Impact:
  - If attacker has >50% total hashrate: CAN control chain
  - If attacker has <50%: CANNOT control chain
Mitigation:
  - Start as private network
  - Gradually decentralize
  - Build up honest hashrate before going fully public
  - High minimum difficulty (131k) raises attack cost
```
**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM (depends on network size)

#### Scenario C: All Miners Collude (HIGH RISK)
```
Setup: All your miners work together maliciously
Risk: Complete control of chain
Impact: Can do ANYTHING
Mitigation:
  - This is a governance issue, not technical
  - Trust your infrastructure
  - Use monitoring and alerting
  - Have backup/recovery procedures
```
**Risk Level**: üî¥ HIGH (but requires insider access)

### 51% Attack Cost Analysis

**To attack Halo chain, attacker needs**:

1. **Hardware Cost**:
   - Need >50% of total network hashrate
   - At difficulty 131,072, need powerful GPU(s)
   - Estimated cost: $500-$5,000 (single GPU rig)

2. **Operational Cost**:
   - Electricity: ~$0.10-0.50/hour (depending on GPU)
   - Need to maintain attack continuously
   - Cost increases as honest hashrate grows

3. **Opportunity Cost**:
   - Instead of attacking, could mine honestly
   - Attacking devalues the chain ‚Üí attacker loses money
   - Only profitable if attacker has external incentive (e.g., short position)

**Conclusion**:
- ‚úÖ Attack is EXPENSIVE relative to small network
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Attack becomes CHEAPER if network stays small
- ‚úÖ Attack becomes MORE EXPENSIVE as network grows

---

## 3. Selfish Mining

### Attack Description

Miner hides mined blocks and releases them strategically to gain unfair advantage.

**How it works**:
```
1. Selfish miner finds Block N
2. Keeps it secret (doesn't broadcast)
3. Starts mining Block N+1 on their secret chain
4. Honest miners still mining on Block N-1
5. When honest miner finds Block N:
   - Selfish miner quickly broadcasts BOTH blocks N and N+1
   - Selfish miner's chain is longer ‚Üí wins
   - Honest miner's work is wasted
```

**Profitability**: Requires >25% hashrate to be profitable

**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM (if attacker has 25-50% hashrate)

**Halo-Specific Considerations**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1-second block time makes selfish mining HARDER
  - Less time to decide strategy
  - Network propagation becomes critical
- ‚úÖ Uncle rewards (if properly implemented) reduce selfish mining incentive
- ‚úÖ Fast block times mean attacker's secret chain harder to maintain

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ Fast block propagation (1s doesn't give much time to hide)
- ‚úÖ Uncle rewards incentivize publishing all blocks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still possible if attacker has good network position

---

## 4. Timestamp Manipulation

### Attack Description

Miner manipulates block timestamps to influence difficulty adjustment.

**How it works**:
```
1. Miner wants LOWER difficulty:
   - Sets timestamp LATER than real time
   - Makes it look like blocks came slowly
   - Difficulty decreases

2. Miner wants HIGHER difficulty:
   - Sets timestamp EARLIER than real time
   - Makes it look like blocks came quickly
   - Difficulty increases (weird, but possible for griefing)
```

**Halo's Protections**:

```go
// 1. Timestamp must be greater than parent
if header.Time <= parent.Time {
    return errOlderBlockTime
}

// 2. Timestamp cannot be too far in future
allowedFutureBlockTime = 15 * time.Second
if header.Time > time.Now() + allowedFutureBlockTime {
    return errFutureBlock
}

// 3. Time delta capped at 60 seconds in difficulty calculation
if timeDelta > 60 {
    timeDelta = 60
}
```

**Attack Scenarios**:

#### Scenario A: Timestamp Too Old
```
Attempt: Set timestamp = parent.Time (or less)
Result: Block REJECTED ‚úÖ
Reason: errOlderBlockTime
```

#### Scenario B: Timestamp Too Future
```
Attempt: Set timestamp = now + 20 seconds
Result: Block REJECTED ‚úÖ
Reason: More than 15s in future
```

#### Scenario C: Timestamp Slightly Future (Manipulation)
```
Attempt: Set timestamp = now + 14 seconds
Result: Block ACCEPTED ‚ö†Ô∏è
Impact:
  - Can make blocks appear to come slowly
  - Difficulty might decrease
  - But LIMITED: next miner will use real time
  - Hybrid protection prevents major drops
Risk: üü° MEDIUM - Can cause minor instability
```

**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM (limited by protections)

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ Strict timestamp validation (¬±15 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Time delta cap at 60 seconds
- ‚úÖ Hybrid difficulty prevents manipulation from causing major drops
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor manipulation still possible but not profitable

## 5. Uncle/Orphan Block Attacks

### Halo's Uncle Block Configuration

```go
// From consensus/ethash/consensus.go
HaloMaxUncles = 1         // Maximum 1 uncle per block
HaloMaxUncleDepth = 2     // Uncles can be max 2 blocks deep

// Uncle rewards (from mutations/rewards_halo.go):
Depth 1: 50% of block reward (500/1000)
Depth 2: 75.0% of block reward (375/1000)
Nephew reward: 1.5% per uncle (15/1000)
```

### Attack Vector: Uncle Stuffing

**Description**: Miner intentionally creates forks to maximize uncle rewards.

**How it works**:
```
Miner with 2 mining rigs:
1. Rig A mines Block N
2. Rig B simultaneously mines Block N (intentional fork)
3. Rig A's block becomes canonical
4. Rig B's block becomes uncle
5. Miner includes uncle in Block N+1
6. Miner earns: Block reward + Uncle reward + Nephew reward
```

**Profit Calculation**:
```
Normal mining: 5 HALO per block
Uncle stuffing:
  - Block N reward: 5 HALO
  - Block N+1 reward: 5 HALO
  - Uncle reward (depth 1): 5 * 0.875 = 4.375 HALO
  - Nephew reward: 5 * 0.031 = 0.155 HALO
  - Total: 14.53 HALO for 2 blocks worth of work
  - Normal would be: 10 HALO
  - Profit: +45.3% ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM (profitable for miners with multiple rigs)

**Mitigations**:
- ‚úÖ Maximum 1 uncle per block (limits profit)
- ‚úÖ Maximum depth 2 (old uncles expire)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still profitable, but less than other chains
- ‚úÖ 1-second block time makes intentional forking harder

**Recommendation**:
- ‚úÖ Current uncle rewards are acceptable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor for excessive uncle rates
- üîµ Consider reducing uncle rewards if abuse detected

---

## 6. Network Splitting Attacks

### Attack Description

Attacker tries to split network into two partitions that mine separate chains.

**How it works**:
```
1. Attacker controls network routing
2. Prevents half of miners from seeing other half
3. Each half mines their own chain
4. When partition ends, longer chain wins
5. Shorter chain's blocks are orphaned (wasted work)
```

**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM (requires network control)

**Halo-Specific Considerations**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Permissioned network initially ‚Üí fewer nodes ‚Üí easier to partition
- ‚úÖ Shorter partition recovery time (1s blocks vs 13s Ethereum)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More reorgs during partition due to faster blocks

**Mitigations**:
- ‚úÖ Run nodes in multiple geographic locations
- ‚úÖ Use multiple network providers
- ‚úÖ Monitor for network partitions (missing blocks)
- ‚úÖ Implement network health checks

---

## 7. Mining Pool Attacks

### Attack Vector: Pool Hopping

**Description**: Miners switch between pools to maximize profit.

**How it works**:
```
1. Pool A has high rewards this hour ‚Üí Join Pool A
2. Pool B has high rewards next hour ‚Üí Switch to Pool B
3. Result: Miners extract maximum rewards
4. Pools suffer from inconsistent hashrate
```

**Risk Level**: üü¢ LOW (not really an "attack", just economic optimization)

**Mitigation**: Not needed (this is normal behavior)

---

### Attack Vector: Pool Sabotage

**Description**: Miner joins pool but submits invalid shares to waste pool's resources.

**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM (griefing attack)

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ Pools should validate shares before accepting
- ‚úÖ Ban miners submitting invalid shares
- ‚úÖ Require minimum share submission rate

---

## 8. Economic Attacks

### Attack Vector: Flash Crash Mining

**Description**: During HALO price crash, miners leave, difficulty drops, attacker profits.

**How it works**:
```
1. HALO price drops 50%
2. Honest miners shut down (not profitable)
3. Difficulty drops over next 100 blocks
4. Attacker with cheap electricity:
   - Mines at low difficulty
   - Accumulates HALO cheaply
   - Waits for price to recover
```

**Risk Level**: üü° MEDIUM (economic opportunity, not malicious)

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ Hybrid difficulty prevents rapid drops
- ‚úÖ Historical floor (50% of 100 blocks ago) provides stability
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still possible for patient attackers

---

### Attack Vector: Short & Attack

**Description**: Attacker shorts HALO token, then attacks chain to drive price down.

**How it works**:
```
1. Attacker opens large short position on HALO
2. Attacker launches 51% attack or disrupts network
3. Price crashes due to lost confidence
4. Attacker profits from short position
```

**Risk Level**: üî¥ HIGH (if attack is cheap and short position is large)

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ High minimum difficulty (131k) makes attack expensive
- ‚úÖ Hybrid protection makes sustained attack very difficult
- ‚úÖ Monitoring and rapid response
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't prevent if attacker has sufficient resources

---
